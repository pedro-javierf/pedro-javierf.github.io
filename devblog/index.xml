      <description>Introduction - Part 1 Everything comes to an end, and so does the 3DS series. In this first part I&amp;rsquo;ll pave the way to go through the whole exploit chain that leads to native code execution in the ARM11 and ARM9 processors of the Nintendo 3DS. A successful example of black-box hacking, reversing and exploiting.
 Let&amp;rsquo;s begin with some memes to alleviate the reading 
The strategy to follow is:</description>

      <title>Is safe design being taught at Computer Engineering degrees?</title>

      <description>The definite question about cybersecurity As a third year student of Computer Engineering at a known University in Madrid and an information secuirty enthusiast, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but panic when the subject is taught incorrectly or misleadingly.
Needless to say, progress has been made in the last years. We have a course specifically designed to teach computer networks security. The university does not prosecute you if you find vulnerabilities in their systems, they know about responsive disclosure and acknowledge you instead.</description>

      <description>Abstract Let&amp;rsquo;s see how to solve the &amp;ldquo;Fiesta&amp;rdquo; challenge from Riscure Embedded Hardware CTF 2016 using electromagnetic Fault Injection.
This challenge has some lore/story behind, and is specifically designed to be solved using Fault Injection techniques.
Tools To solve the challenge I use exclusively my own Electromagnetic Fault Injector
Challenge and Solution Upload the executable .hex to an arduino NANO, and let&amp;rsquo;s observe the serial output (19200 bauds), we observe the device is somehow &amp;ldquo;locked&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Abstract Today&amp;rsquo;s post will cover the theory and crafting of an Electromagnetic Fault Injection device for as little as $5.
¬øWhat is Fault Injection? Fault injection is a term widely used in the hardware and systems security scene. It is the act of introducing logic errors (software errors) into CPUs by altering the underlying hardware. This allows an attacker to exploit a processor even if it were running a 100% safe code.</description>

      <title>Advanced Ghidra Loader: labels, overlays and Function ID</title>

      <description>Foundation Last month we saw the basics of a Ghidra Loader, a type of extension for Ghidra. Now we&amp;rsquo;ll see some additional features to step up the functionality, usability and quality of our loader.
I will cover these features in increasing complexity order.
Labels Often when working with embedded systems we find architectures that are conceptually simple. Usually, code is loaded statically (always at the same address) or libraries are static.</description>

      <description>Introduction All aboard the reversing train! It&amp;rsquo;s april 2020 and the whole world has slowed down due to COVID-19. I figured this is a good oportunity to keep learning. Since I&amp;rsquo;m trying to move on from paid software reverse-engineering ,I started to embrace free and open-sourced alternatives.This would be decent to learn about Ghidra internals. Specially I wanted to write a loader for an unsupported format.
What is a loader?</description>

      <title>Hacking The 3ds IV: Hardware attacks</title>

      <description>Introduction Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about hardware hacking, mostly targeting the Nintendo 3ds hardware, but certainly related to other distinct targets.
I have tried to create a post which explains with the maximum level of detail each attack / reversing procedure. I consider this useful as a learning resource for future generations. Moreover, it should also work as preservation for a lot of 3ds &amp;ldquo;scene&amp;rdquo; content back from as soon as 2011, which is getting lost and disappearing from internet; this includes images, posts, texts, plus some of my comments.</description>

      <description>Introduction Welcome again. Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s time to go back and continue hacking the Nintendo 3ds. Previously, I got raw RAM dumps where several unicode strings could be found, evidencing the data was not encrypted or secured at all in RAM. This also applies for code, binary&amp;rsquo;s code sections may be also loaded in memory (as we saw using entropy) so we can extract them and reverse them.
Identifying code Even though I used binvis and could clearly see the differences between data and code, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t precise enough to get addresses.</description>

      <description>Hello again! I&amp;rsquo;m back with part 2: &amp;ldquo;Finding The Pattern&amp;rdquo;! In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t read yet the first blog entry, click here.
Brief Summary Back in the day, I analysed what possible entry-points the 3DS may have. We lead to the conclusion that the RAM contents were not encrypted. This is something useful. Here&#39;s proof:
 Unicode string found in the RAM Dump.
 As you can see, if we search for unicode strings (remember the 3DS supports several languages, as everything should do this days, to enable non-ascii languages to work, i.</description>

      <description>Hello back! Today, a new series begin. A &amp;ldquo;journey&amp;rdquo; into hacking the Nintendo 3DS Handheld Console starts. There are several reasons why I am going to do this series;
 Personal Interest. During the later 2014, the 3DS Scene started growing. I was there, and was told I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get anything. The obnoxious sceners and community, only working for fame and personal interest. The lack of information and documentation about hacking blindly (Which is basically what I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing here) Exploit development is exciting and challenging</description>

      <title>Twicexploit: Windows UAC Bypass</title>
      <link>https://pedrojavier.com/devblog/bypassuac/</link>

      <description>Hello My Fellow Readers!
Today I&amp;rsquo;m back to write about UAC bypassing, that amazing scene that malware writers love.
 What is UAC?
Since windows vista, Microsoft implemented the so called User Account Control (UAC); a mechanism which manages processes privileges. Basically, if you have a windows account which has administrator rights, and you run an application that doesn&amp;rsquo;t requiere administrator rights, UAC will drop the unnecessary privilges; This is done to avoid malwares having full control of the computer if they get code execution; to get admin rights UAC will prompt a question windows which will ask the user for permission, making malwares&amp;rsquo; job harder.</description>
